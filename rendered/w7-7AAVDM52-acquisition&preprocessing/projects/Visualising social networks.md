#### 1. Visualising Social Network Dynamics in Historical Events: The Arab Spring

- **Project Description**
	- This project focuses on the Arab Spring as a case study to examine the role of social networks in mobilizing, communicating, and spreading information during significant social movements. By analyzing Twitter data from the period, students will explore the evolution of discussions, key themes, network structures, and sentiment over time.

- **Problem Statement**
	- Social networks have become pivotal in modern social movements, serving as platforms for organization, communication, and information dissemination. The Arab Spring is a prime example of digital activism's impact on political change.

- **Initial Questions**:
  1. How did the volume and sentiment of tweets related to the Arab Spring change throughout the event?
  2. What were the predominant themes discussed, and how did these evolve?
  3. How did the network structure of participants evolve, and what does this reveal about information spread?
