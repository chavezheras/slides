4. Crime Patterns in Major Cities

- **Project Description**
	- Analyze and visualize crime patterns in major cities, focusing on types of crimes, temporal patterns, and geographical distribution. This project aims to uncover insights into urban safety and inform policy decisions.

- **Problem Statement**
	- Urban areas face diverse crime challenges that vary by type, time, and location. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective public safety strategies and resource allocation.

- **Initial Questions**:
  1. What are the most common types of crimes in different city areas?
  2. How do crime rates vary by time of day, week, or year?
  3. What are the spatial patterns of crime distribution within the city?

- **Data Sources**: Public crime data from major city police departments, such as the Chicago Data Portal ([Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)). [GOV UK](http://gov.uk/), Specific datasets can be found online:

- **Suggested Toolkit**:
  - Excel or Google Sheets for preliminary analysis
  - QGIS or ArcGIS for spatial analysis
  - Python (Pandas for data manipulation, Folium for mapping)
