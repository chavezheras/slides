#### 2. Urban Green Spaces and Public Well-being

- **Project Description** 
	- This project investigates the correlation between urban green spaces and public well-being indicators such as physical health, mental health, and social cohesion. Utilizing GIS data on green spaces and public health statistics, students will map the distribution of green spaces and analyze their accessibility and impact on urban populations.

- **Problem Statement**
	- As urban areas expand, the role of green spaces in promoting public well-being becomes increasingly vital. This project aims to explore how urban green spaces contribute to healthier communities through their availability and accessibility.

- **Initial Questions**:
  1. What is the distribution and accessibility of green spaces within a selected urban area?
  2. Is there a correlation between proximity to green spaces and improved health indicators?
  3. How do socioeconomic factors influence access to green spaces and their effects on well-being?

- **Data Sources**: Satellite imagery and public health data from sources like NASA Earth Data ([NASA Earth Data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) which also has a tutorials section) and [Open Data UK](https://www.data.gov.uk/), [WHO](https://platform.who.int/data/).Specific datasets can be found online, such as:
	- https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/ (also see the fingertips Python API).
	- https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/students/resources/quick-start-hse/ (registration required).
	- https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/345751

- **Suggested Toolkit**:
  - Google Earth or Google Maps for basic mapping
  - QGIS for detailed GIS analysis
  - Python (Geopandas for spatial analysis, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization)
