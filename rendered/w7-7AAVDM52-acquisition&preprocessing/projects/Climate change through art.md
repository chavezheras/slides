- **Project Description**
	- Analyse the representation of nature and environmental themes in artwork over the last century to explore how artistic expressions reflect changing attitudes towards climate change. By examining museum collection data, students will identify trends in environmental themes and correlate these with major environmental events.
    
- **Problem Statement**
	- Art reflects societal values and concerns, including attitudes towards the environment and climate change. This project seeks to understand how environmental themes in art have evolved in response to climate change awareness and events.
    
- **Initial questions:**
    1. How have environmental themes in art changed over time, especially in response to climate change?
    2. Can we correlate shifts in artistic themes with major environmental events or milestones in climate change awareness?
    3. How do different art forms (painting, sculpture, installation) vary in their representation of environmental themes?
