3. The Digital Divide in Education

- **Project Description**
	- This project examines the impact of the digital divide on educational outcomes by comparing internet access data with educational performance indicators across different regions. Students will explore how disparities in digital access correlate with variations in educational achievements and the implications for policy and educational equity.

- **Problem Statement**
	- The digital divide poses a significant barrier to educational equity, with varying internet access levels contributing to disparities in educational outcomes. This project seeks to understand these disparities to inform strategies for enhancing educational access and quality.

- **Initial Questions**:
  1. How does internet access correlate with educational performance across different regions or demographic groups?
  2. What are the trends in digital access disparities, and how do they impact educational equity?
  3. How do urban and rural areas differ in terms of the digital divide and its impact on education?

- **Data Sources**: Internet access and educational outcome data by region from the World Bank Open Data ([World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)).  Specific datasets also available online:
