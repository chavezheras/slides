#### 6. Environmental Changes in the Amazon Rainforest

- **Longer Project Description** 
	- Visualize the rate and patterns of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, correlating with policy changes and environmental impacts. This project seeks to quantify deforestation's effects and explore the drivers behind this critical environmental issue.

- **Problem Statement**
	- The Amazon rainforest is experiencing rapid deforestation, impacting biodiversity, climate, and indigenous communities. Understanding these patterns is essential for formulating strategies to mitigate environmental damage.

- **Initial Questions**:
  1. How has deforestation in the Amazon changed over time?
  2. What are the primary drivers of deforestation in different Amazon regions?
  3. How do policy changes correlate with deforestation rates?

- **Data Sources**: Satellite imagery and deforestation data from Global Forest Watch ([Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/)) or NASA Earth Data ([NASA Earth Data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/). Specific dataset are also available online
