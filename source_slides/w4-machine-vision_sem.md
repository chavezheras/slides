2023-24

note:
This week we focus on images and on how computers see them. We take a dive in the sub-field of AI known as computer vision, going over its history, objectives, and applications. We then place computer vision in the wider context of technologies and theories of vision, from photography to text-to-image systems.

note:
No, but they can process images of the world in ways that are useful and sometimes resemble the ways in which we see the world.
