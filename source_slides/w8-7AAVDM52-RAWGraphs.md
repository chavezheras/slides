# Visualising data with RAWGraphs
## Data Visualisation ― week 8

[Dr Daniel Chávez Heras](https://movingpixel.net/)

[7AAVDM52](https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=108839)

2023-24

note:
This week students will learn about data visualisation using RAWGraphs, an open web tool to create custom vector-based visualizations. The session will cover the basic principles of the tool, how to load data, how to perform basic transformations, and how to export, share and collaborate with others to create basic visualisations like bar charts and line graphs, and other more advanced types such as treemap, stream graph, and matrix plot.

## Why RAWGraphs?

- No fee and no registration required. RAWGraphs is ==open and free== for everybody
- RAWGraphs ==doesn’t store data.==
- Open outputs optimised for your design process.
 - Supports a wide range of visualisations that are not readily available in other tools.
- Allows you to handle large datasets ==directly in your browser== without any programming knowledge.
- Useful for initial exploratory and explanatory data visualisation.
- Ideal for researchers, data journalists, and students!

# 2. Getting started with RAW Graphs

![](fas fa-tools fa-4x)

### Initial assumption
Richer countries pollute more than poorer countries.

### Initial question
Is there a co-relation between a country's income and how much it pollutes?

---
 ## 1. Data acquisition

CO2 emissions per country per year:
- [Global Carbon Atlas](https://globalcarbonatlas.org/)
- [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?year_high_desc=true)

GDP per country per year:
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

## 2. Preprocessing

##  3. RAW Graphs!

1. Load your data
2. Choose a chart
3. Map your data dimensions to the visual variables of the chart
4. Tune your visualisation and export

Data can be loaded in the following ways:

- Paste from a table
- ==Load a file in tabular format==
- ==From a URL==
- From a SPARQL query
- From one of our data samples
- ==Opening a .rawgraphs project==

---
RAWGraphs accepts only a single table!
To load from a file, the accepted formats are:

- .tsv
- ==.csv==
- .dsv
- .json
