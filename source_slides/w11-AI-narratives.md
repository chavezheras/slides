note:
This week we focus on the stories we and other tell about AI, and why they matter, even (or especially) when, they are wrong. We take a closer look at how AI has become part of the global economy, and how it is developing in other parts of the world, including examples of how it threatens democracy and stability in various parts of the world like Africa or Latin America.

# 1. The stories we tell...
## ...and why they matter

![](fas fa-comments fa-4x)

# The fabric of the real

![[media/3717f2909d178575023c786983b17935_MD5.jpg]]

1. We have beliefs about the world
2. We act according to those beliefs
3. Beliefs are influenced by the stories we tell (to ourselves and to others)
4. Stories are deeply connected to how we act upon the world


note: 
People's beliefs can be based on incomplete or incorrect information, ideologically skewed, factually incorrect.

## AI narratives matter

note:
much more so than you might initially imagine.

![](fas fa-quote-left fa-2x)

>Popular excitement and concerns about an emerging technology ==influence public and policy debates==, and shape the cost- (or risk-) benefit analysis publics make about that technology.

![](fas fa-quote-right fa-2x)

\- Portrayals and perceptions of AI report

![](fas fa-quote-left fa-2x)

>Technology can be ==a lightning rod for broader social narratives or concerns==, which can draw debate away from the actual risks and benefits of a technology. 

![](fas fa-quote-right fa-2x)

\- Portrayals and perceptions of AI report

note:
who benefits and who is at risk

![](fas fa-quote-left fa-2x)

>The reception of a technology can be shaped by perceptions of ==who benefits and who is at risk== from technological developments.

note:
The Future of Life institute, the thinktank that coordinated the effort, cited 12 pieces of research from experts including university academics as well as current and former employees of OpenAI, Google and its subsidiary DeepMind. 

Critics have accused the Future of Life Institute (FLI), which has received funding from the Musk foundation, of prioritising imagined apocalyptic scenarios over more immediate concerns about AI – such as racist or sexist biases being programmed into the machines.

and reception of new technologies.

## New meanings for existing language

- Neural networks

- (machine) Learning

# 2. Hopes and Fears
## Utopia and Dystopia

![](fas fa-theater-masks fa-4x)

![[media/cc38fd2811aebaa0f48aad963ab11cb1_MD5.jpg|1000]]

- Hyper-intelligence
- Curing disease
- Freeing humans from having to work
- Gratifying every human desire
- Making the world a safer place
- "Solving" death


note:
e.g. AGI
Humanoid robots, glowing brains, outstretched robot hands, or...
Silicon valley utopianism, or the Californian ideology.
Technological determinism.

note:
 A paradoxical hybridization of beliefs from the political left and right in the form of hopeful technological determinism.

![[media/ba6403726106318292c682eb71514f0f_MD5.jpg]] 

- Loosing our humanity
- Making humans obsolete
- Total alienation
- Enslavement by machines
- Extinction

note: 
The terminator.
Decades if not centuries away, or never going to happen.
A tiny subset of a sub-field that gets blown out of proportion

# 3. Anthropomorphisation
## All too human non-humans

![](fas fa-robot fa-4x)

---

![[media/AI_search.png|1700]]

note:
Aassumptions about gender, ethnicity and religion. They set unrealistic expectations and misrepresentation of the possibilities and limitations of AI.

note:
As a result, these robots are gendered, hypermasculine killing machines, like the Terminator ―Arnols Swarzenegger
Sexualised conventionally beautiful women like Ava in Ex-Machina ―Alicia Vikander

---

## Machines that look like (some) of us:

1. Humans are the most ==intelligent creatures==
2. Visual story telling relies on ==characters with bodies==


note:
More difficult to have a character being a collective, or a non physical entity, a virus, or a planet
Other intelligent creatures ara available, like the octopus

# 4. Counter narratives
## other stories are available

![](fas fa-exchange-alt fa-4x)

## In popular culture

note:
Counter-narratives can be found in less prevalent AI fictions. For instance, the 1997 film Conceiving Ada directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson provides a social
commentary on the relationship between people and technology. In this film, the AI researcher is female, played by Tilda Swinton; moreover, the AI is embodied
as a dog and as a bird, instead of in human form. The film is unusual in using AI to reframe the way in which historically significant events are described in order to
highlight the roles and perspectives of women. M. John Harrison’s Kefahuchi Tract trilogy of novels offers radical imaginings of human intimacy with algorithms, code and mathematics. Such narratives offer necessarily different perspectives on the power dynamics of AI, gender and embodiment.

"Better Images of AI" is a non-profit collaboration of various individuals, non-profit and academic institutions in the UK, e.g. BBC R&D, the Ada Lovelace Institute, and a charity organisation called We and AI.

note:
Refracted version of ourselves. Refraction is when a weave changes direction and shape as it passes from one medium to another. In optics this often refers to how light is bent and reshaped as it goes through different lenses. Controlling the shape of light through optical lenses is one of the key principles of photography. 
What we now think of as AI is built on top photographic images.

In a wider sense: AI creates multiple refractions of culture; multiple versions of events, and observations that are brought together to form a coherent whole.

note:
These photographs are known as “die-shots“. 
A die is a small block of semiconducting material, such as Silicon, that serves as the supporting material on which an integrated circuit is fabricated. 
Die-shots are close-up photographs of computer chips, from which the “packaging“ is removed. The typical bright rainbow colors in die-shots do not represent the actual colors of the chips, which are mainly gray and silver. The artist has used a combination of external light sources, polarising filters on the camera lense and image post production to create the colourful effect. This picture shows a “Radeon R9 290” by AMD.

# The road behind

> [!tip] In summary:
> 1. The stories we tell shape our beliefs, and we act on those beliefs
> 2. Exaggerated hopes and fears about technology obfuscate real issues
> 3. Anthropomorphisation of AI mystifies the technology
> 4. Counter narratives exist. More are needed


note:
Think again about the Gemini video at the beginning:
"Timeless mission"
"The world's information"
"Universally accessible"
"Truly universal"
"Most beneficial for humanity"
