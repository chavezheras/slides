# 1. Why storytelling?

![](fas fa-theater-masks fa-4x)

<i class=""></i>

## Data informs, story persuades

- Gives the viewer a vantage point, provides ==orientation==
- Enables the viewer to ==focus== on aspects that are more important than others
- Engages viewers at an ==emotional level==
- Challenges or reinforces the ==beliefs== of viewers

note:
Visual storytelling in the context of data visualisation is about more than just presenting data; it mobilises the systems of belief of users to involve them, and thus persuade them

## Narratology

>The study of narrative structure and the ways if affects human perception

- Roots in the western tradition can be traced to Aristotle (Poetics)
- 20th century narratology - [Tzvetan Todorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzvetan_Todorov), [Mikhail Bakhtin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakhtin). Both looking at the earlier work of the Russian Formalists and [Vladimir Propp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp).
- 21st century _cognitive_ naratology - [David Herman](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Herman%2C%20David%22)


note:
quote by Felluga, Dino. "General Introduction to Narratology." (2011) _Introductory Guide to Critical Theory_.
Aristotle was concerned with drama: The surviving book of _Poetics_ is primarily concerned with drama; the analysis of [tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy "Tragedy") constitutes the core of the discussion. e.g. Catharsis. 
Todorov: _Grammaire du Décaméron_, 1969 
Propp: _Morphology of the tale_, 1928 
Bakhtin: _[The Dialogic Imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dialogic_Imagination)_ (1975)

# 3. Concepts and techniques

## Key concepts

- Change over time (usually characters, but also variables!)
- Narrative arc (shape of the story)
- Fabula (story) and Syuzhet (plot)

note: 
characters, settings, conflict, resolution

## Kurt Vonnegut on the shape of stories

Freytag's pyramid

German novelist Gustav Freytag _[Die Technik des Dramas](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Die_Technik_des_Dramas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Die Technik des Dramas (page does not exist)")_ (1863)

Other narrative shapes:

- [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)
- [Kishōtenketsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu)

note:
Kishōtenketsu: Chinese, Korean and Japanese narratives. Originated from Chinese poetry

![[media/cf626da3bd1ae4cc14ce194adb4d8714_MD5.png]]
- Fabula (==story==): all the events that occur in the sequence in which they happened.
- Syuzhet (==plot==): the specific events told in the order in which they are told.

## Selective withholding

> Purposeful organisation of what characters knows vs what audiences know.

Different aesthetic effects:
- Restricted narration: audiences **know less** than characters --> ==mystery==
- Unrestricted narration: audiences **know more** than characters --> ==suspense==

# 4. Interactive data narratives

![](fas fa-gamepad fa-4x)

note:
Case studies from the pudding and information is beautiful

note:
do you have a question & can it be answered with data?
Do the data exist?
Is it ethical to collect it?
Are the results of analysis interesting?
Are you the right person to tell the story?
Create a plan or a storyboard
Build it!

## Controlling time

- User navigation: left to right, top to bottom; clicking, tapping, scrolling?
- Tapping, swiping, sliding.
- One point, one chart.
- "Scrollytelling" when content (e.g., a graphic) is revealed or changed as the user scrolls. It does not alter scroll behavior, but simply monitors it.

note:
interaction and layout go together
