2023-24

note:
This week we focus on images and on how computers see them. We take a dive in the sub-field of AI known as computer vision, going over its history, objectives, and applications. We then place computer vision in the wider context of technologies and theories of vision, from photography to text-to-image systems.

> 3. Find your seminar group in the tabs at the bottom
> 4. Write the name for your team in one of the spaces under the cell called "Team name" in one of the red cells (only one of you needs to do this).
> 5. Find your name and chose your team number using the drop down menu in column C.
