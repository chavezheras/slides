2023-24

note:
This week we delve into the world of visual representations and examine the principles by which markings on a surface are made and interpreted. This is large area of research, drawing from disciplines such as art, architecture, typography, cartography, and engineering. We explore some of the most salient aspects of visual representation and visual aesthetics as they are applied to design.

### Purpose and Power of Data Visualization

- **Sense-making and Communication**: Transforming abstract information into visual forms.
- **Visual Attributes**: Utilizing length, position, size, shape, and color.
- **Example**: Line graphs reveal trends more effectively than tables.
- ![Line Graph Example](https://example.com/line-graph.jpg)
---

### Historical Context of Data Visualization

- **Early Practices**: Data arranged in tables since the 2nd century C.E.
- **Graphical Representation**: Introduced by Rene Descartes in the 17th century.
- **Innovations by William Playfair**: Pioneered line and bar graphs in the 18th century.
- [More on William Playfair](https://www.historyofinformation.com/playfair)
---

### Evolution and Modern Approaches

- **20th Century Advancements**: Significant contributions by Jacques Bertin, John Tukey, Edward Tufte, and William Cleveland.
- **Information Visualization**: Emergence as a research field.
- **Modern Tools**: Advancements in practical applications, e.g., Tableau Software.
- [Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com)

## Data Visualization and Human Perception

---

### Why perception?

- **Aligning with Perception**: Effective visualization matches how we discern and understand information.
- **Leveraging Visual Perception**: Faster and more efficient than cognition.
- **Gestalt Principles**: Informing effective visualization design.
- ![Gestalt Principles](https://example.com/gestalt-principles.jpg)
---

### Preattentive Processing and Attention Mechanisms

- **Rapid Information Processing**: Leveraging basic visual attributes for quick understanding.
- **Example**: Differences in length, size, hue, and color intensity as visualization elements.
- [Preattentive Processing Explained](https://www.visualexplained.com/preattentive)
---

### Comparing Effectiveness of Different Visualizations

- **Effectiveness Criteria**: Accuracy, ease of understanding, and alignment with human perceptual abilities.
- **Pie Charts vs. Bar Graphs**: Illustrating the importance of choosing suitable visualization methods.
- ![Pie Chart vs. Bar Graph](https://example.com/pie-vs-bar.jpg)
---

### Challenges and Misuse

- **Popularity and Misrepresentation**: Balancing aesthetic appeal with accurate data representation.
- **Objective**: Effective communication of data while considering human perception.

## Emotional Aspects of Data Engagement
---

### Emotions in Data Engagement

- **Role of Emotions**: Significant in how people interact with data and visualizations.
- **Beyond Objectivity**: Highlighting emotional responses to data visualizations.
- **Example**: Surprise, fear, or pleasure in response to design and content.
- ![Emotional Response](https://example.com/emotional-response.jpg)
---

### Datafication and Emotional Response

- **Quantifying Social Aspects**: Transformation into quantifiable data.
- **Emotional Impact**: Data not just about numbers but also about feelings they evoke.
- **Example**: Emotional responses to social media metrics.
- [Datafication and Society](https://www.dataficationandsociety.org)
---

### Visualizations and Emotional Impact

- **Aesthetic and Emotional Impact**: Design influences emotional response.
- **Importance of Design**: Attractiveness can enhance engagement.
- **Example**: Positive response to visually appealing graphs.
- ![Visually Appealing Graph](https://example.com/visually-appealing-graph.jpg)
---

### Sociology of Emotions and Everyday Life

- **Integrating Sociology**: Understanding emotional engagement with data in daily life.
- **Emotions as Part of Experience**: Central to how people make sense of data.
- **Example**: Overwhelm or anxiety about challenging social data.
- [Sociology of Emotions](https://www.sociologyofemotions.com)
---

### Empirical Research on Data Engagement

- **Research Methods**: Focus groups, diary-keeping to explore engagement.
- **Diverse Emotional Responses**: To different aspects of data and visualizations.
- **Example**: Varied reactions based on personal context and data presented.
- ![Focus Group Discussion](https://example.com/focus-group.jpg)
---

### Emotional Design in Visualizations

- **Considering Emotional Design**: Enhancing engagement and understanding.
- **Positive Emotional Responses**: Can make visualizations more effective.
- **Example**: Infographics resonating emotionally with the audience.
- ![Emotional Design in Infographics](https://example.com/emotional-infographics.jpg)
---

### Implications for Data Studies

- **Holistic Approach**: Including emotional responses in understanding data engagement.
- **Influence on Understanding and Decision-Making**: Future research focus.
- **Objective**: Integrating emotional aspects into data visualization and interpretation.
